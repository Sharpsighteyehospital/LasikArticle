# Lasik: which can reimburse your 20/20 vision!
Lasik is the latest vision corrective surgery for a very delicate part of the eye. Millions of people have tried this latest procedure and corrected their vision within a few days. If you’re wearing glasses and contact lenses, you must be thinking about this surgery to get rid of glasses and contact lenses.

In Lasik Surgery, basically the procedure helps to reshape the cornea that improves your vision.

**Before going for this procedure, here are a few key points about the procedure:**<br><br>
•	LASIK is that surgery applicable to the delicate part of your eye, and it will not be reversed.<br>
•	Your age should be 18 years or above (which is the best time to get your LASIK procedure done where vision is more likely to stop changing).<br>
•	Your cornea thickness should be good and healthy to get this procedure. Generally, your eyes' overall health should be good.<br>
•	You really need to have realistic expectations from Lasik.

**Here are a few points which make you a non-suitable candidate for Lasik.**<br>
•	Unstable refractive error.<br>
•	Extreme level of myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism more than +5.0 diopter in hypermetropia & more than – 9.0 diopter myopia.<br>
•	Dry Eyes<br>

Your ophthalmologist needs to talk to you on these terms and make you understand what will be the best treatment for your vision. If you’re a suitable candidate for LASIK then your ophthalmologist will take you to a few examinations. Here is a list:<br>

•	The overall eyes health will be checked<br>
•	Measurements of your cornea<br>
•	Your pupil size will be checked<br>
•	Refractive error will be checked<br>

If these tests are fine, then you are the perfect candidate for Lasik Procedure.

**Expectations from Lasik**
When you have decided to go for Lasik, make sure you’re not feel pressured by an ophthalmologist, family, friends, or anyone else to make a decision about having surgery. You should carefully consider all the pros and cons.

**The day before surgery, as per your ophthalmologist consultation you should stop using:**
•	Using eye creams<br>
•	Using lotions<br>
•	Eye Makeup<br>
•	False eyelashes<br>
•	Perfumes<br>

These products can increase the risk of infection during or after the Lasik procedure. Your ophthalmologist may ask you to follow certain precautions prior to surgery to avoid the risk of infection so that your procedure can go smoothly and normally.

Before surgery, you really need to arrange all the transportation for the hospital till you come to your home. On the day of surgery, your doctor may give you some medicines and will ask you to rest because this medicine can decrease your ability to drive and read. Also, after the surgery, your vision may be blurry which is why you will be not able to drive then you need to arrange certain arrangements for your traveling on that particular day. 

**During Surgery**<br>
The procedure will take less than 10 minutes. The surgery will be started by a large machine with a microscope attached to it and a computer screen. A numbing drop will be applied to your eye, your eyes will be cleaned before entering the procedure and an instrument called a lid speculum will be used to hold your eyelids open till the surgery. And, then the procedure will start.

**After the Surgery**<br>
After your procedure, your eye may burn, itch, and feel little irritation. You may feel certain discomfort or may feel mild pain but your doctor will suggest you a mild pain reliever that will help you to heal quickly. Your vision will be probably hazy and blurry. But you will be prohibited to touch or rub your eyes for several hours. If you rub your eyes after the surgery it may add more risk to your eyes, your flap may displace, and will require more treatment to correct it. These signs may be improved within the first few days of your surgery. You need to be in touch with your doctor until this procedure is closed.
